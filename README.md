## Quick Start

### Requirements

* [CMake](https://cmake.org) 3.4.3

### Supported Platforms

The test suite that exercises Stdutils has been built and passes successfully
on the following platforms:
* GNU/Linux using GCC 5.5.0, 6.4.0, 7.3.0
* GNU/Linux using Clang 5.0, 6.0
* OS X Sierra (10.12) using Apple Xcode 9.2
* OS X High Sierra (10.13) using Apple Xcode 9.4, 10.0 
* Windows using Visual Studio 2017 (x86 and x64)

### Obtaining the Source Code

The source code can be obtained from

        git clone git@github.com:stigrs/stdutils.git

### Building the Software

These steps assumes that the source code of this repository has been cloned
into a directory called `stdutils`.

1. Create a directory to contain the build outputs:

        cd stdutils
        mkdir build
        cd build

2. Configure CMake to use the compiler of your choice (you can see a list by
   running `cmake --help`):

        cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ..

3. Build the software (in this case in the Release configuration):

        cmake --build . --config Release

4. Run the test suite:

        ctest -C Release

5. Install the software:

        cmake --build . --config Release --target install

   All tests should pass, indicating that your platform is fully supported.
